Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development

Pros:

The small tests in TDD forces you to write code that is more structurally sound, meaning that the code has to be unit-testable in order to follow TDD. TDD also makes code easier to maintain and improve, it also makes group collaboration easier because the small tests make it easy to see if new code added produces the desired outcomes. Following TDD also forces programmers to have a more solid understanding of the code, as a deep understanding is necessary to write the modular tests. 

Cons:

Writing tests can be expensive and time consuming during the development process, because writing tests can be tedious and some tests can be difficult to write. It is also hard to optimize the benefits of TDD if tests are not well-written, or if only part of the development team is following TDD properly. Lastly, TDD can be hard to learn and get used to if a programmer is used to writing code in other ways.
